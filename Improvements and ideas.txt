Improvements/ideas for future development:
- Adding sound
- Adding a "toss the coin" animation to pick the player to start
- Adding more VFX:
	- A trail on the pieces
	- A smoke puff or similar when placing a piece
	- Victory particles (confettis)
- Implement a store with presets for:
	- Board (the base of it)
	- Tiles (may need to relate to board to avoid artistic direction discrepancies)
	- Pawns (could be sets for both players)
	- VFXs (for trails, placement smoke puffs, etc.)
- Adding some presets for the board tiles and/or pawns (maybe a preset should contains a visual for both the tiles and pawns, to avoid discrepancies in the artistic direction)
- Adding a decor around the game board
- Adding more physical feedbacks to pieces
	- When placing them
	- When one is placed nearby
	- When a tic-tac-toe is formed (exaggerated since it's the end move)
- On the codebase side, add some tools to handle DOTween animation with components setup in the inspector, which I haven't done yet since there were not much of them
- Adding a mode versus bot
